# deep-learning-project
This is the Github repository for my DATA 492 (Deep Learning) project. We will be using various data from the Bloomberg Terminal to analyze the predictability of LTSM and other neural networks for predicting the stock price of various instiutions compared to traditional machine learning methods such as linear and non-linear regression.
